# Space Shooter Game

## Overview

This repository contains a space shooter game developed in C as a part of the CS210 course (Semester 4) project. The main objective of the project was to enhance the understanding of computer architecture. In the game, players control a spaceship to defend Earth from incoming asteroids by blasting them with projectiles. The game is specifically designed to run on the DE1-SoC development board, utilizing its peripherals such as the PS2 keyboard and VGA display.

## Features

- **Space Shooter Gameplay**: Defend Earth from asteroids using a spaceship with projectile weapons.
- **Graphics**: Integrated directly within the main program through arrays.
- **Peripheral Integration**: Utilizes DE1-SoC specific addresses for peripherals like the PS2 keyboard and VGA display.
- **Tested**: Thoroughly tested to ensure proper functionality in the simulator [cpulator](https://cpulator.01xz.net/).

## Repository Contents

- **images/**: Contains images and sprites used in the game.
- **python/**: Python programs used during the development process.
- **report/**: The project report detailing the development process and technical details.
